# Steel Power Usage Explorer
# Steel Power Usage ðŸ”Œâš¡

Small FastAPI + React app for exploring the **Steel Industry Energy Consumption** dataset.

## Features
| REST endpoint | What it does |
|---------------|--------------|
| `/records`    | Returns raw usage records with filters for date range, day of week, weekend, and load type
| `/stats`      | Returns a single statistic (sum, mean, median, min, max) on filtered data
| `/stats/daily`| Returns a daily mean kWh time-series. They can be used to build a chart

Filters are optional & combinable, so you can answer questions like:

* What was the average active power for the full dataset? 
* MWhat was the minimum Maximum_Load kWh usage?  
* What was the daily average from March to May 2018?  
* What was the maximum consumption on Mondays in October 2018?  
* What was the weekend usage in September 2018?
